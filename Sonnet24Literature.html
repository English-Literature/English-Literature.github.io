Shakespeare’s Sonnets; Sonnet 24
<br>
<strong style=color:pink>Mine eye hath played the painter</strong> and <strong style=color:blue>hath stelled
Thy</strong> beauty’s form in table of my heart;
<strong style=color:purple>My body is the frame wherein ’tis held</strong>,
And perspective it is best painter’s art.
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictured lies,
Which in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,
That hath his windows glazèd with thine eyes.
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
<strong style=color:pink>Mine eyes have drawn thy shape</strong>, and thine <strong style=color:blue>for me
Are</strong> windows to my breast, wherethrough <strong style=color:pink>the sun<strong style=color:blue>(Also an enjambment)</strong>
Delights to peep, to gaze</strong> therein on thee.
<strong style=color:pink>Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art:
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</strong>
<br>
(Folger Shakespeare Library, 2022)
<br>
<strong style=color:pink>Pink:</strong> Personification, where a non-human thing is given human aspects, for example in this poem eyes want, draw, play and know, and the sun delights and peeps.
<strong style=color:purple>Purple:</strong> Metaphor. A comparison without using like or as. Here, the speaker compares his body to the frame of a painting.
<strong style=color:blue>Blue:</strong> Enjambment, when the sentence is unfinished and the meaning is incomplete when the verse ends.
