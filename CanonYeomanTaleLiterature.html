With this Chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer,
                    With this Canon I have dwelt seven years,
721         And of his science am I never the neer.
                    And as to his science I am never the nearer (to success).
722         Al that I hadde I have lost therby,
                    All that I had I have lost thereby,
723         And, God woot, so hath many mo than I.
                    And, God knows, so have many more than I.
724         Ther I was wont to be right fressh <strong style=color:blue>and gay</strong>
                    Where I was accustomed to be right fresh and gay
725         <strong style=color:blue>Of clothyng</strong> and of oother good array,
                    Of clothing and of other splendid furnishings,
726         Now may I were an hose upon myn heed;
                    Now may I wear a hose upon my head;
727         And wher my colour was bothe fressh and reed,
                    And whereas my color was both fresh and red,
728         <strong style=color:lightgreen> Now is it wan and of a leden hewe --</strong>
                    Now is it pale and of a leaden hue --
729         Whoso it useth, soore shal he rewe! --
                    Whoever uses it (that art), sorely shall he rue! --
730         And of my swynk yet blered is myn ye.
                    And by my work yet my eye is bleared.

733         <strong style=color:orange>That</strong> <strong style=color:blue>I have</strong> no good, wher that evere I fare;
                    That I have no possessions, wherever I fare;
734         And yet I am endetted <strong style=color:blue>so therby</strong>
                    And yet by this I am so indebted
735         <strong style=color:blue>Of gold</strong> that I have borwed, trewely,
                    For gold that I have borrowed, truly,
736         That whil I lyve I shal it quite nevere.
                    That while I live I shall never repay it.
737         Lat every man be war by me for evere!
                    Let every man be warned by me forever!
738         What <strong style=color:red>maner man</strong> that casteth hym therto,
