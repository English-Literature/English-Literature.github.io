    <p>Thomas Gray's early childhood was riddled with death, as he was the only one of his 12 siblings to make it past infancy. This could have contributed to Gray getting into elagiac poetry, which is the genre he is most famous for, having written 'Elegy In A Country Graveyard'.</p>
    <h1>The full poem</h1>
    <p> Here, freed from pain, secure from misery, lies
        <br>
        A child, the darling of his parents’ eyes:
        <br>
        A gentler lamb n’er sported on the plain,
        <br>
        A fairer flower will never bloom again:
        <br>
        Few were the days allotted to his breath;
        <br>
        Now let him sleep in peace his night of death.</p>
