        Here,<strong style="color:#75aa77;"> freed from </strong> pain, secure from misery,<strong style="color: #9985c9;"> lies
        <br>
        <strong style="color: #e8b04c;">A</strong> child </strong>, the darling of his parents’ eyes:
        <br>
        <strong style="color: #e8b04c;">A</strong> <strong style="color: #4eae9c;">gentler lamb</strong> n’er sported on the plain,
        <br>
        <strong style="color: #e8b04c;">A</strong><strong style="color:#75aa77;"> fairer flower </strong>will never bloom again:
        <br>
        <strong style="color: #ba4040">Few were the days allotted to his breath</strong>;
        <br>
        Now let him <strong style="color: #ba4040">sleep in peace</strong> his night of death.</i></h3>  
    
   <p><strong style="color:#75aa77;">The stylistic figure we see here is called alliteration, which consists of the first letter or sound of a word being repeated multiple times in close proximity, like we see here with 'freed from' and 'fairer flower'.</strong>
       <br>
       <strong style="color: #9985c9;">This is a run on lines, often used to emphazise the last and first words of a line. It is used here to stress that this is the tumbstone of a child. </strong>
       <br>
       <strong style="color: #e8b04c;">Our next stylistic is called an 'Anaphora' which means that the first word of a line gets re-used as the first word of other lines. These sentences can also be seen as enumeration, a literary device where multiple of the same thing get noted (in this case qualities of the child)</strong>
       <br>
       <strong style="color: #4eae9c;">This is a metaphor, here to represent the innocence of the child due to being represented as a lamb.</strong>
       <br>
       <strong style="color: #ba4040">These lines are examples of a eufimism, a way to soften a harsh statement. In this case the harsh statement is the fact that the child had passed away </strong>
