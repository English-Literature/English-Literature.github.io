The</strong> jeperdies, the wayes, and the wyle,
By what menis he might this cok begyle.

Dissimuland in to <strong style=color:red>countenance</strong> and <strong style=color:red>cheer</strong>,
On knees fell and simuland thus he said,
"Gude morne, my maister, gentil Chantecleer!"
With that the cok start bakwart in ane braid.
"Schir, by my saul, ye need not be effraid,
Nor yit for me to start nor flee abak;

As I have done to your progenitouris.

Syne said that Dirgie when that he was deed.
Betwixt us twa how suld there be ane feid?

"Ye are, me think, changed and <strong style=color:blue>degenerate
Fra</strong> your father and his conditioun,
Of <strong style=color:red>craftie crawing</strong> he might beer the croun,
For he weld on his tais stand and craw.
This is no le; I stude beside and saw."

With that the cok, upon his tais hie,
Kest up his beek and sang with all his might.
Quod schir Lowrence, "Well said, sa mot I the.
Ye are your fatheris son and heir upright,
Bot of his cunning yit ye want ane slight."
"What?" quad the cok. "He wald, and have na doubt,
Baith wink, and craw, and turne him thryis about."

The cok, inflate with wind and fals vanegloir,
That mony puttes unto confusioun,
Traisting to win ane greet worship therefoir,
Unwarlie <strong style=color:red>winkand walkit</strong> up and doun,
<strong style=color:orange>And</strong> syne to chant and craw he made him boun—
<strong style=color:orange>And</strong> suddandlie, by he had crawin ane note
The fox was war, and hent him by the throte.
