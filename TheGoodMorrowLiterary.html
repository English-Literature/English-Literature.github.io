The Good-Morrow, John Donne
<br>
I wonder, by my troth, what thou <strong style=color:blue> and I
Did</strong>, till we loved? <strong style=color:red>Were we</strong> not <strong style=color:red>weaned</strong> <strong style=color:purple>(Were we not weaned) till then?
But <strong style=color:brown>sucked on country</strong> pleasures, childishly?</strong>
Or snorted we in the <strong style=color:red>Seven Sleepers’</strong> den?
’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.
<strong style=color:purple>If ever any beauty I did see,
Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee.</strong>
<br>
<strong style=color:blue>Blue:</strong> An enjambment/run-on-lines, where the sentence is unfinished and the meaning are unfinished at the end of the verse.
<strong style=color:red>Red:</strong> An alliteration, where two or more words that are close together start with the same letter.
<strong style=color:brown>Brown:</strong> Assonance, where similar sounds are repeated, in this case the u in "sucked", the o in "on" and the ou in "country".
<strong style=color:purple>Purple:</strong> A metaphor, which is a comparison without like or as. In verse 2, the discovery of their love is compared to the weaning (the act of stopping a child's breastfeeding) of the lovers.
The metaphor in verse 6-7 is the comparison of previous loves of the speaker and the beauty of his newest love.
<br>
And now good-morrow to our waking souls,
<strong style=color:red>Which watch</strong> not one another out of fear;
<strong style=color:silver>For love, all love of other sights controls,
And makes one little room an everywhere.</strong>
<strong style=color:orange>Let</strong> sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,
<strong style=color:orange>Let</strong> maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,
<strong style=color:orange>Let</strong> us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.
<br>
<strong style=color:red>Red:</strong> More alliteration.
<strong style=color:silver>Silver:</strong> A hyperbole, which is an extreme exaggeration. In this case, the speaker's love is exaggerated, as it is physically impossible for it to control everything ot take up space.
<strong style=color:orange>Orange:</strong> An anaphora, which is when multiple following verses start with the same word.
<br>
My face in <strong style=color:brown>thine eye</strong>, <strong style=color:brown>thine</strong> in <strong style=color:brown>mine</strong> appears,
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;
Where can we find two better hemispheres,
Without sharp north, without declining west?
Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;
If our two loves be one, or, thou <strong style=color:blue>and I
Love</strong> so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.
<br>
<strong style=color:brown>Brown:</strong> Assonance, in this case the i in "thine" and the word "eye" make the same sound.
<strong style=color:blue>Blue:</strong> Another enjambment.
