How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
        <br>
            <strong style="color: #9985c9;">  I love thee </strong>to the<strong style="color:#75aa77;"> depth and breadth and height </strong>
        <br>
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
        <br>
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
        <br>
            <strong style="color: #9985c9;">I love thee </strong>to the level of every day's
        <br>
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
        <br>
            <strong style="color: #9985c9;">I love thee  </strong>freely, as men strive for right.
        <br>
            <strong style="color: #9985c9;">I love thee</strong> purely, as they turn from praise.
        <br>
            <strong style="color: #9985c9;">I love thee</strong> with the passion put to use
        <br>
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
        <br>
            <strong style="color: #9985c9;">I love thee</strong> with a love I seemed to lose
        <br>
            With my lost saints.<strong style="color: #9985c9;"> I love thee </strong> with the <strong style="color:#75aa77;">breath,
        <br>
            Smiles, tears,</strong> of all my life; and, if God choose,
        <br>
            <strong style="color: #9985c9;">I shall but love thee </strong> better after death.</i></h3>
    
<p> 
    <strong style="color: #9985c9;">These lines contain both anaphora as well as repitition, anaphora is used when you repeat the first word of a sentence or line and repitition is to repeat a word group multiple times. In this case both are being used at the same time.</strong>
    <br>
    <strong style="color:#75aa77;">This literary device is called enumeration, being used to establish multiple concepts of equal value, in this case being used to sum up multiple equal and closely related concepts. </strong>
