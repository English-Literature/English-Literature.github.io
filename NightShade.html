A large crowd gathers at the public square of the tiny town called Thudge. 
Most came here for one thing: death. 
It was quite a stormy day, a depressing gray sky loomed over the town whilst 
rain poured down on it. The rare moments of peace and quiet gave way to aggressive 
gusts of wind just as quickly as they had formed. In the middle of the square 
stood two people, one of them bound with chains. The other, the much  burlier 
one, seemed to lead the first to a large wooden platform brought to the plaza 
just for this kind of occasion, which thankfully doesn’t occur all too often. 
As the two of them walked past the riotous crowd the contained one suddenly 
collapsed unto the ground, with a panicked look on his face. The one accompanying 
him surely was surprised at this sudden development but on the other hand didn’t 
really seem to care, he had a job to do, even if his transportee didn’t want to 
come with him. Which frankly was understandable, no one wants to go to the gallows, 
they just don’t have a say in the matter. So they continued walking, the shadows 
of the colossal construct creeping closer with each step they took. The gallows 
had surely seen better days, one of the support beams had been infested with a 
terrible wood rot, causing the piece of timber to become all flaky and crumbly. 
The flight of stairs creaked enthausuasticly whenever someone was brave enough 
to climb them. The trapdoor beneath the hangman’s knot was nailed shut, it had 
already malfunctioned before so the townspeople didn’t wish to deal with it 
anymore. So instead of using a mechanically advanced trapdoor they simply 
pushed criminals off the wooden platform, this was found to be a much 
simpler alternative to the whole trapdoor shenanigans. 
The stairs began to squeak and squeal as the two figures slowly made 
their way to the top of the wooden construction. The smaller one still 
held that frightened look in his eyes, the other struggled to hold on 
to his indifference. 
Time was up.
He knew his time was up.
Yet he didn’t understand why his time was up when all faded to white.


July 27th 1561
“It’s a lovely day today isn’t it? I mean I can barely see any clouds in the 
sky. Well except maybe that one over there, it kind of looks like a loaf of 
bread. What do you think George?”

	“Didn’t you just eat breakfast? I can’t believe you’re thinking about 
    food right now.” Said George with his ever so energetic smile.
I really don’t know how he does it, how he always stays so incredibly optimistic. 
All I know is that his smile is simply contagious.

	“Hey Daniel, do you want to go to the woods today? I heard the blueberries 
    are blooming early this year, they might make a good snack if you’re still 
    hungry.” He said quite anxiously, which isn’t too unusual for George. His 
    freckles and carefree attitude didn’t hide the fact that he was still terribly 
    afraid of the dark and still fell for the cautionary tales we’re told.

	“We both know you’re just too afraid to go alone, besides you knew I wasn’t 
    going to pass up on that offer, it beats helping my dad prepare for the harvest 
    season” I said, trying to sound as courageous as I could. Although my façade 
    fell trough as well, we both knew that both of us weren’t brave enough to go 
    into the woods by ourselves, but with each other it felt like we could face 
    the world itself.

I eventually stood up and offered George a hand, which he gladly took. He may be 
the brightest light this town has ever seen, but it’s not like he’ll ever put more 
effort into anything than strictly necessary. And just like that we left for the 
woods, we walked past numerous wooden houses, some equipped with beautiful gardens 
and others with just a simple path leading from door to door. We walked over dirt 
paths, trough the city centre, young kids, cattle, poultry all walking chaotically 
throughout that cramped main square. We passed by merchants selling fruits, cloth, 
leather, meat and everything in between (one of them actually offered me an apple, 
which I promptly took with me). Eventually the bustling city environment gave way 
to more open farmlands and that’s when we finally saw it, a gigantic dark oak forrest 
spreading out hundreds of miles in every direction imaginable. The forrest is 
actually the main reason why the town hadn’t expanded all that much over the last 
50 years, the woods are apparently so dense that claiming the land for farming 
proved to be more trouble than it was worth. Still there’s said to be a clearing 
somewhere in those woodlands where blueberries grew, and we were determined to 
find it. Or at least we were determined to find it until we set our sights upon 
a mighty fallen tree, which I (of course) dared George to climb. He fell. To no 
ones surprise he fell down from the fallen tree. I felt sorry for him of course 
but it was kind of funny. After I helped him up we had to leave though, it was 
close to lunch time and I started getting even more hungry.

It's a shame we never got to eat those blueberries.

September 16th 1573
	“It’s a shame we grew apart isn’t it?” I asked George, who still looks almost 
    the same as 12 years ago.
	“I mean just remember all the good times we had together as kids, yet here we 
    are right now talking to each other as if we are barely acquaintances”.
	“I mean it doesn’t surprise me” Responded George “we just had our own separate 
    lives to live, over the years we simply had less time to spend with each other, 
    we’re actually quite lucky we have some spare time today.”.

	“And why’s that?” I asked, curiously.

	“Well I know how last time you were really bummed about missing those blueberries, 
    so I thought we could maybe look for them again? For old times sake.” George asked, 
    with a slight glistering in his eyes.

Like all those years ago I couldn’t help but accept his offer. But unlike years ago we 
actually managed to find the clearing! It was such a magnificent sight, the occasional 
rays of sunlight that found their way to the ground lit up the baffling variety of 
flora and fauna present in those fabled woodlands, stunning flowers all around you, 
from red lilies to cornflowers to a great number of purple bell shaped flowers.
 And as George fled of to somewhere else, I found them. The long awaited blueberries. 
Now I only got to eat a couple of them before George seemed to call my name. As I 
looked over I saw a familiar sight: a large fallen tree, the same one as all those 
years ago, and george was standing on top of it.
It was a lovely sight to see, until I passed out from a horrible migraine attack.

When I woke would be the first time I saw it. A horrible melting face with empty 
diluted eyes. Freakishly white skin that hung loosely off that creatures bones. 
A devil unlike any I had ever heard of before. It began speaking in tongues to me, 
but I couldn’t respond. My throat was too sore and dry to say anything, had that 
creature stolen my ability to speak? Had that thing caused all the suffering I was 
going trough? It must have.

September 17th 1573
I’m being taken to the town square.
I’m being taken by someone, something perhaps? 
I can’t quite see. Everything is to bright for me.
I hear a crowd in the distance, why has a crowd gathered there? There aren’t 
any merchants today are there?
I’ll just keep walking with my eyes closed.
But what’s out there?
Curiosity got the better of me.
I opened my eyes.
There are so many of them, how are there so many of them?
I thought there’d be just one out there in the forest.
But no, hundreds. Hundreds of pairs of those lifeless eyes staring at me. 
Hundreds of those pale melting faces.
I fall down, overwhelmed.
I get dragged up a stage.
I close my eyes for the last time.
As it all fades to black.
