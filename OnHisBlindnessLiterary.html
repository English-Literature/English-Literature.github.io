On his Blindness, John Milton
(Sometimes a part of the verse is repeated in brackets, to show when multiple literary devices are used in one part of a verse.)
" <strong style=color:mediumpurple>When I consider how my light is spent <strong style=color:yellow>(When I consider how my light is spent)</strong> <strong style=color:blue>(is spent)
Ere</strong> half my days</strong> in <strong style=color:purple>this dark world</strong> and wide, <strong style=color:red>(world and wide)</strong>
And that one talent which is death <strong style=color:blue>to hide
Lodg'd</strong> with me useless, though my soul <strong style=color:blue>more bent
To</strong> serve therewith my Maker, <strong style=color:blue>and present
My</strong> true account, lest he returning chide,
"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"
I fondly ask. But <strong style=color:pink>Patience</strong>, <strong style=color:blue>to prevent
That</strong> murmur, soon replies: <strong stle=color:purple>"God doth <strong style=color:blue>not need
Either</strong> man's work or his own gifts: <strong style=color:blue>who best
Bear</strong> his mild yoke, they serve him best. <strong style=color:blue>His state
Is</strong> kingly; thousands at his <strong style=color:blue>bidding speed
And</strong> post o'er land and ocean without rest:</strong>
They also serve who only stand and wait.‚Äù 
<br>
<strong style=color:yellow>Yellow:</strong> A pun, which is a play on words. Here, "light" can mean both the author's eyesight and the light of day.
<strong style=color:blue>Blue:</strong> Enjambment/run-on-lines, where the sentence is unfinished and the meaning is incomplete when the verse ends.
<strong style=color:mediumpurple>Light Blue:</strong> A paradox, which is an apparent contradiction. Here, the author speaks about how he spends his days, yet his light is gone before half of his days are over.
<strong style=color:purple>Purple:</strong> A metaphor, which is a comparison without like or as. Here, the author compares his lack of sight to an imaginary world with a lack of sight.
<strong style=color:red>Red:</strong> An alliteration, where two or more words that are close to each other start with the same letter,
<strong style=color:pink>Pink:</strong> A personification, where a non-human thing is given human aspects. Here, Patience is not a human, but it represents the virtues that the author strives to achieve.
